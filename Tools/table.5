.Dt TABLE 5 "Standard Cell Library"
.Os LibreSilicon
.Sh NAME
.Nm table
.Nd description file format for Truth Tables as used by the
.Xr scarbata 1
tool.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This is a secondary file format for the Standard Cell Library, inspired by tables from
User-defined Primitives (UDP) in Verilog (defined in IEEE Std 1394-1995 and IEEE Std 1394-2001),
and influenced by the
.Xr cell 5
file format.
.Pp
The
.Nm
file consists of newline separated ASCII records.
.Pp
Every line starts with comment, an identifier, or forms a table entry.
.Ss // 
Two slash signs mark the beginning of a comment line; subsequent characters up
to the end of the line are not interpreted by the routines which search the
file.
.Ss .inputs
This dot-command follows a white-space-separated list of strings (terminated by
the end of the line) giving the formal input signal names for the following table being
declared.
.Ss .outputs
This dot-command follows a white-space-separated list of strings (terminated by
the end of the line) giving the formal output signals for the cell being
delared.
.Ss .clocks
This dot-command follows a white-space-separated list of strings (terminated by
the end of the line) giving the clock signal names for the following table being declared.
This command is optional; e.g., for purely combinational circuits.
.Ss .table
This identifier following all table entry lines, until the
.Em end
identifier.
.Ss .end
This identifier indicates the end of table entry line section.
.Pp
Every table line contains rows of values in the following order:
.Bl -ohang
.It Em .outputs
A list of space-separeted Output values.
.It Em :
The colon sign devided the Output Node side of table from the following Nodes.
.It Em .clocks
Optional clock signal values, when mentioned, are followed by another
.It Em :
Colon sign.
.It Em .inputs
Behind last colon sign all Input values are listed.
.El
.Pp
Valid values for common Input, Clock or Output nodes are:
.Bl -column -offset indent ".Sy Value" ".Sy alternative" ".Sy Description"
.It Sy Value Ta Sy alternative Ta Sy Description
.It Li 0 Ta L Ta logical '0', or low
.It Li 1 Ta H Ta logical '1', or high
.It Li ? Ta -, * Ta don't care, or ignored
.It Li X Ta Ta unknown, or undefined
.El
.Pp
In addition to valid common values, on Clock nodes are also valid:
.Bl -column -offset indent ".Sy Value" ".Sy alternative" ".Sy Description"
.It Sy Value Ta Sy alternative Ta Sy Description
.It Li / Ta R, P, (01) Ta rising or positive edge
.It Li \e Ta F, N, (10) Ta falling or negative edge
.El
.Pp
In addition to valid common values, on Output nodes is also valid:
.Bl -column -offset indent ".Sy Value" ".Sy alternative" ".Sy Description"
.It Sy Value Ta Sy alternative Ta Sy Description
.It Li Z Ta Ta tri-stated, also known as hi-Z, floating, or high impedance
