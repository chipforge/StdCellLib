.Sh NAME
.Nm cobblestone
.Nd generates physical VLSI layouts
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl H Ar number
.Op Fl T Ar file
.Op Fl s Ar rule-set
.Op Fl e Ar format
.Ar cell-file
.Nm
.Fl h | \-help
.Nm
.Fl \-version
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility generates physical VLSI layout descriptions in different file formats (
.Em lef ,
.Em magic ,
.Em svg
)  and writes out the layout information on
.Dv STDOUT .
.Pp
.RE
.Nm
functionality is to take one cell description and generate the corresponding
layout information based on sufficient heuristics.
.Pp
.Sh OPTIONS
.Ss \-e format
Specify the layout file format in which the VLSI layout should be generated.
.Bl -ohang
.It Em lef
Library Exchange Format (proprietary)
.It Em magic
Magic VLSI layout tool format (preferred)
.It Em svg
Scalable Vector Graphics
.El
.Ss \-h, \-\-help
Display help message and exit.
.Ss \-H number
Specify the Highth of a cell by number of metal tracks (e.g. 7 or higher).
Fractional numbers could work inaccurate.
The Width of cells varies with transistor sizes and numbers.
.Ss \-s rule-set
Specify the built-in MOSIS rule set which should be used.
.Bl -ohang
.It Em scmos
Scalable CMOS
.It Em subm
Sub-Micron
.It Em deep
Deep sub-micron
.It Em user
User defined
.El
.Ss \-T file
Specify the configuration file (written in TOML) with all user-defined values.
This file contains at least the path to the technology file, transistor sizes
and cell hight.
Values in the configuration file can be over-ruled by command-line options,
when feasible, e.g.
.Op Fl H Ar number
.Ss \-v
Print verbose messages at
.Dv STDERR .
.Ss \-\-version
Print
.Nm Ns 's
version number and exit.
.Ss cell-file
describes the cell itself beside the netlist with some other informations.
For the exact file format, see
.Xr cell 5
