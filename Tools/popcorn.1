.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility expands a given combinatorial cell by different methods (
.Em aoi ,
.Em nand ,
.Em none ,
.Em nor ,
.Em oai ,
.Em pd ,
.Em pu
)  and writes out the new derived cell information on
.Dv STDOUT .
The new cell name and a cell description for the new cell can be specified.
.Pp
In principle every combinatorial cell (in CMOS technology) contains two
functional complementary networks.
This are the pull-up network - build with pMOS transistors - as well as the
pull-down network - build with nMOS transistors.
In both networks all inputs are used to determine the output functionality.

.RE
.Nm
functionality is to take one combinatorial cell and expand both networks
by adding complementary transistors for each network.
.Pp
The generator functionality can be used recursively.
This implies that one new generated cell becomes the seed for at least one more
generated cell.
.Pp
.Sh OPTIONS
.Ss \-b Ar number
Append inverting buffer to current cell description, when one path (in one of
both networks) exist which has at least a
.Em number
of stacked transistors between output and any supply line.
This will sharpen the maximum LOW\- and minimum HIGH\-level outputs of the cell.
.Ss \-c Ar cell\-name
Specify the cell name for the new generated cell.
.Ss \-D Ar string
Specify the new cell functionality in a quoted string, e.g. "Not (or Inverter)
gate" which occurs in generated cell documentation.
.Ss \-h, \-\-help
Display help message and exit.
.Ss \-m Ar method
Expand cell with one of following methods:
.Bl -ohang
.It Em aoi
Add nMOS transistor in serial into highest free pull\-down path.
Use new character for last mosfet gate name, enumerate this character for new
mosfet gate name.
.It Em nand
Add nMOS transistor in serial into highest free pull\-down path and perform
the complementary operation for the pull\-up network.
Use same character and next number for new mosfet gate name.
.It Em none
Do not expand cell. This is the default value.
.It Em nor
Add pMOS transistor in serial into highest free pull-up path and perform
the complementary operation for the pull\-down network.
Use same character and next number for new mosfet gate name.
.It Em oai
Add pMOS transistor in serial into highest free pull\-up path.
Choose new character for last mosfet gate name, enumerate this character for new
mosfet gate name.
.It Em pd
Add a nMOS transistors in parallel to the exisiting pull\-down network and perform
the complementary operation for the pull\-up network.
Choose new character for new mosfet gate names.
.It Em pu
Add a pMOS transistors in parallel to the exisiting pull\-up network and perform
the complementary operation for pull\-down network.
Choose new character for new mosfet gate names.
.El
.Pp
An addition in one network always implies an complementary addition for the other
network also.
.Ss \-T Ar file
Specify the configuration file (written in TOML) with all user\-defined values.
This file contains at least the path to the technology file, transistor sizes
and cell hight.
Values in the configuration file can be over\-ruled by command line options,
when feasible, e.g.
.Op Fl b Ar number .
.Ss \-v
Print verbose messages at
.Dv STDERR .
.Ss \-\-version
Print
.Nm Ns 's
version number and exit.
.Ss Ar cell\-file
describes the cell itself beside the netlist with some other informations.
